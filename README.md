# rssbot
Open Source Automation tools developed and once used for the rssbot.org project, which is now retired. 

# rssbot.org - A legacy personal project
The rssbot.org project was a feed aggregation and search interface that lived from 2004-2016. I have since let the domain name expire, but I still run the bot on my linux workstation, at home.

# rssbot.py
The rssbot.py script was an experimental version of the rssbot.org automated feed collection engine. There is also a version written in perl and php, and the python version seemed to perform the best. Add threading, and it would be ideal, but I never got around to it.
