# rssbot
Open Source Automation tools developed and once used for the rssbot.org project, which is now retired. 

The rssbot.org project was a feed aggregation and search interface that lived from 2004-2016. I have since let the domain name expire, but I still run the bot on my linux workstation, at home.
